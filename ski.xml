<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such
hazards as trees, ice, bare ground, and the Yeti, &mdash; a horrible
monster!  Each turn moves you one screen row downhill.  Unfortunately,
you have to put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see
ahead where you are going; only behind where you have been.</para>

<para>However, you can turn to either side, jump or hop through the air,
teleport through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the
Fire Demon.  And since the hazards occur in patches, you can skillfully
out-maneuver them.</para>

<para>You ski until something bad happens to you.  Your final score is
based on how far you have skied, how many jumps you made, how many
Yetis have melted during your run, and how healthy you are when are
finished.</para>

<para>These characters represent the things that you see on the slope
behind you:</para>

  <listitem>
<para>This is the Yeti!  As soon as he crawls out of a snowbank, he
will lumber directly towards you at one space per turn, and if he gets
within one space of you, he will grab you and beat you up!  However,
he has trouble moving through trees.  Steer clear from the Yeti, and
he will melt after a while, since it is a sunny day.  If you jump over
him, your jet-powered skis will help melt him.  You can also melt him
with nuclear ICBMs, or call the Fire Demon who will cook him, but once
a Yeti melts, another one always shows up after a while.  The Yeti
doesn't understand about the edges of the slope either, so you can
just cross them to get away from him!  And since he is slower than
you, you can try to ski right past him before he can grab you!</para>

<para>This represents a nuclear ICBM that you launched.  You launch
them from your backpack, and they zoom right at the Yeti.</para>

<para>This is the Fire Demon, who is always your friend unless you
call him a bad name and he gets mad at you.</para>

</variablelist>

<para>These are your commands.  You can type any one of these letters
when you have the "?" prompt on the end of the slope line, or just hit
a return to do nothing this turn.  Preceding any command with a number
does that command repeatedly; thus, for example, <quote>4l</quote> is
<quote>turn left 4 times</quote>.</para>

<variablelist remap='IP'>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>r</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Turn to the right.  If you were going straight down, this will
make you go one space to the right every turn.  If you type "R" again,
then you will go two spaces to the right every turn.  If you type "L"
the next turn, you will again be going one space to the right every
turn.  Remember that you can't turn when you are on ice, and if you go
off the edge of the slope you come back into the other edge.  You
travel farther while you are going sideways, so you get a better score
if you slalom to the side a lot, but you can never go sideways more
than five spaces per turn.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>l</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Turn left.  Exactly the same as turning right, but totally
opposite.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>j</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Jump.  When jumping, you don't have the "?" on the right for each
line you jump over, so you can't enter a command for it.  You can't
fall, hit trees, or get grabbed by the Yeti while jumping, but
you might land badly and get hurt.
Since the Yeti moves one space toward you each turn, you
have to be going at least two spaces per turn sideways to jump
over him without getting grabbed when you land, but your jet-powered
skis may melt the Yeti while you're jumping over him.</para>

fall down.</para>

  <listitem>
<para>Launch ICBM with nuclear warhead.  If your backpack is working well,
an ICBM will be launched from it towards the Yeti, travelling at
three spaces per turn.  Launching ICBMs is dangerous, but once one is
going, it can't hurt you.  If it is launched and loses its negative-infrared
lock on the Yeti, it self-destructs.</para>

  <term>d</term>
  <listitem>
<para>Cast spell to summon the Fire Demon to this material plane.  If
the alternate universes are in a synchronous phase, the Fire Demon
will appear somewhere on the slope, and move to attack the Yeti at
one space per turn, but if something goes wrong while casting this
spell, the Fire Demon might get mad and decide to go for you instead
of the Yeti!  If there is no Yeti around, the Fire Demon will soon
get bored and go home.  If you don't like where the Fire Demon showed
up, you can try to recast this spell, so that he will appear somewhere
else.</para>

  <listitem>
<para>Spawn an invisible monster called a Unix shell. You may type to
the shell; it will do strange things with your input, opening a space
warp in the middle of the ski-slope to display them at you. The shell
monster is polite; when it is done, you will be deposited back on your
slope exactly where you were before.</para>
