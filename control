Description: A hotdogging game, evade the deadly Yeti on your jet-powered skis
 Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as
 trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti!  Unfortunately,
 you have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see
 ahead where you are going; only behind where you have been.  However,
 you can turn to either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport
 through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the
 Fire Demon.  And since the hazards occur in patches, you can
 skillfully outmaneuver them.  A fun and very silly game that proves
 you don't need fancy graphical user interfaces to have a good time.
